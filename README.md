cinnamon-better-brightness-applet
=================================

Allows to configure screen brightness and time after screen will be turned off

I started from http://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/64 but eventually i've used general idea and commands from original applet

This version allows to:
* manage screen brightness (from 0 to 100%)
* manage time after which screen will be turned off (1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 30, 60 minutes and never - excatly same values are in gnome settings)
